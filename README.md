# QUBINETS-INTERIORS
This repository contains the initial front-end design work I contributed as a Web Design & Development Intern at an Interior Design Company during my one-month internship. My primary responsibilities included:

Designing the front page layout to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
Developing the navigation bar (navbar) and its components for seamless website navigation.
Creating the footer section to maintain design consistency across pages.
Since this was a collaborative project, my contributions were part of a larger development effort, and the full project was not yet completed during my internship.
